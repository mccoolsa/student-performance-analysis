# Student Habits vs Academic Performance 

This project explores how lifestyle habits (like study time, sleep, diet, and social media usage) influence students' academic performance using regression and explainable AI (SHAP).

Note: First upload from python to ipynb for github visualization, definitely could have done a better job with the plots / inputting comments below visuals rather into the code.
